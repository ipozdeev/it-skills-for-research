# assuming the container has port 5432 exposed and port 5432 being
# used already, redirect port 5432 from container to a free port, e.g. 5435
# the following starts container called 'postgres-demo' in detached state
docker run --name postgres-demo -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<choose password> -p 5435:5432 -d postgres 

# now, it is possible to access it, and e.g. run bash, psql etc.
docker exec -it postgres-demo bash

# psql must be run with user postgres created above
root@<container-hash>:/# psql -U postgres
